title: Replacing The Remaining Spark Plugs
layout: post

I've been taking a little bit more time to research what I need to install the roof fan just to make sure I have everything ready before cutting a hole in the roof of the van so in the meantime I decided to replace the remaining 7 spark plugs in the van after replacing #3 which caused a cylinder misfire earlier.

I got 7 NGK DILFR5A11 Laser Iridium spark plugs from RockAuto.com for about $98. After replacing the old ones it seemed that #3 was certainly in the worst shape but the other ones had some discoloration and #1 had a bit of ash deposits.
