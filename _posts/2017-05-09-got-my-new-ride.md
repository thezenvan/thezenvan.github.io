Over the weekend I went a bought my new ride and what will eventually become The Zen Van. The van is a 2013 Nissan NV2500 V8 High Roof with 60,000 miles on it.

There are minor issues with it, the rear right tire is leaking and the passenger side mirror is shaking during drives but those are both easily fixable. There is a bulkhead separating the cab and the cargo area which I will probably remove for additional space.

The cargo walls have a few wood panels that I can probably re-use in the conversion

There are also several lights on the ceiling that I might be able to re-use
